<p>As a former social worker, teacher <strong>Pam Chirichigno</strong> knows that much more goes into creating successful outcomes for students than what she provides in the classroom. And it starts at <strong>home</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Studies have shown that increased parent involvement improves <strong>student achievement</strong>,&rdquo; Pam says. Though she works at a high-performing magnet school in Los Angeles, Pam and her colleagues are concerned that &ldquo;academic achievement in the general school has not shown adequate growth, and parental involvement is low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when there is parental participation, it&rsquo;s not always productive. &ldquo;Our PTA has low membership, and has been known to have arguments amongst the members,&rdquo; says Pam.</p>
<h2>Visit Parents Where They Are</h2>
<p>Teachers at the school&nbsp;&mdash; Buchanan Street Math, Science, and Technology Magnet Center in Highland Park&nbsp;&mdash; have often lamented the lack of parent involvement. The parents who have shown eagerness often aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. So Pam decided it was time for the teachers themselves to help solve the problem.</p>
<p>Pam started the <strong>Parent Engagement Initiative</strong>, which seeks to increase parental involvement through a variety of strategies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Classroom events</h3><p>For instance, parents are being invited to join a schoolwide reading day, as part of the NEA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nea.org/grants/886.htm">Read Across America</a> initiative.</p></li>
<li><h3>Parent summits</h3><p>Teachers organize meetings for parents to both learn and engage with their children and the school.</p></li>
<li><h3>Home visits</h3><p>by classroom teachers, as well as </p>
<h2>Before Convincing the Parents, Convince the Teachers</h2>
<p>To get started, Pam researched different <strong>parent home visit models</strong> and met with a teacher from another LAUSD school who had implemented a similar program.</p>
<p>As tough as it is to get parents to participate, she knows that the plan asks a lot of her fellow teachers. It is essential to get them <strong>on board</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started by establishing a planning committee of teachers with like minds,&rdquo; Pam says of her strategy to <strong>organize</strong> Buchanan&rsquo;s teachers behind the effort. &ldquo;Those teachers are approaching others in an effort to get more <strong>buy-in</strong> before we present to the entire staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key to growing the effort is being intentional about tying <strong>student achievement</strong> to ongoing parent engagement activities. &ldquo;This action will live on as teachers see results,&rdquo; Pam says.</p>
