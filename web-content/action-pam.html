<p>As a former social worker, teacher <strong>Pam Chirichigno</strong> knows that much more goes into creating successful outcomes for students than what she provides in the classroom. And it starts at <strong>home</strong>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studies have shown that increased parent involvement improves <strong>student achievement</strong>,&rdquo; Pam says. Though she works at a high-performing magnet school in Los Angeles, Pam is concerned that &ldquo;academic achievement in the general school has not shown adequate growth, and parental involvement is low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When there is parental participation, it&rsquo;s not always productive. &ldquo;Our PTA has low membership, and has been known to have arguments amongst the members,&rdquo; Pam laments.</p>

<h2>Visit Parents Where They Are</h2>

<p>Teachers at the school, Buchanan Street Math, Science, and Technology Magnet Center in Highland Park, frequently lament the lack of parent involvement from non-magnet families. Though many of these parents have shown willingness to help So Pam decided it was time for the teachers themselves to solve the problem &mdash; by stepping off campus.</p>

<p>So she started the Parent Engagement Initiative, which seeks to increase parental involvement through <strong>home visits</strong> by classroom teachers, as well as organized summits where <strong>parent education</strong> workshops can be offered.</p>

<h2>Before Convincing the Parents, Convince the Teachers</h2>

<p>To get started, Pam <strong>researched</strong> different parent home visit models and met with a teacher from another LAUSD school who had implemented a similar program.</p>

<p>As tough as it is to get parents to participate, she knew that the plan asked a lot of her fellow teachers. It was essential to get them <strong>on board</strong>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I started by establishing a planning committee of teachers with like minds,&rdquo; Pam says of her strategy to <strong>organize</strong> Buchanan&rsquo;s teachers behind the effort. &ldquo;Then those teachers approached others in an effort to get more <strong>buy-in</strong> before we presented to the entire staff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The key to growing the effort is being intentional about tying <strong>student achievement</strong> to ongoing parent engagement activities. &ldquo;This action will live on as teachers see results,&rdquo; Pam says.</p>
