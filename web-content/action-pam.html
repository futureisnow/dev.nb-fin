<p>As a former social worker, teacher <strong>Pam Chirichigno</strong> knows that much more goes into creating successful outcomes for students than what she provides in the classroom. And it starts at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Studies have shown that increased parent involvement improves student achievement,” says Chirichigno. “Our academic achievement has not shown adequate growth over the last three years, and parental involvement at our school is low,” she said, describing the Los Angeles public elementary school where she teaches fifth grade. </p>

<p>When there is parental participation, it’s not always productive. “Our PTA has low membership, and has been known to have arguments amongst the members,” laments Chirichigno.</p>

<p>Though teachers at the school&nbsp;&mdash; Buchanan Street Math Science and Technology Magnet Center in Highland Park&nbsp;&mdash; frequently complain about the lack of parent involvement, Chirichigno decided it was time for the teachers themselves to solve the problem by stepping off campus.</p>

<p>So she started the Parent Engagement Initiative, which seeks to increase parent involvement through home visits by classroom teachers, as well as organized summits where parent education workshops can be offered.</p>

<p>To get started, Chirichigno researched different parent home visit models and met with a teacher from another LAUSD school who had implemented a similar program. But as tough as it is to get parents to participate, she knew that the plan asked a lot of her fellow teachers. It was essential to get them on board.</p>

<p>“I started by establishing a planning committee of teachers with like minds,” says Chirichigno of her strategy to organize Buchanan’s teachers behind the effort. “Then those teachers approached others in an effort to get more buy-in before we presented to the entire staff.”</p>

<p>The key to growing the effort is showing measurable gains. “This action will live on as teachers see results.”</p>
