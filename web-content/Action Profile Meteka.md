#Creating a Pilot School

*Los Angeles teacher Meteka Bullard and her fellow teachers want to “lift the ceiling on innovation” at Baldwin Hills Elementary.*

There’s a lot of talk lately about the need for intervention in urban schools that fail to put the best teachers in front of the kids who need them most. But what about a school where the teachers are experienced and the students excel? 

It turns out even high-performing schools need the right supports to nourish a thriving academic culture. At Baldwin Hills Elementary and Gifted/High Ability Magnet School in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the renowned and decorated veteran staff were beginning to feel stifled. 

We focus on urban schools that fail to put quality teachers in front of the classroom. But what about schools where the teachers are awesome and aren’t being allowed to innovate? Baldwin Hills has veteran teachers who get great outcomes because they are masters of their craft, they constantly innovate new curricular ideas and efforts, and they put in extra time and all their heart. But this high-performing school hit up against strictures in the district that were keeping it from excelling.
