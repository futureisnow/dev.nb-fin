#Creating a Pilot School

*Los Angeles teacher Meteka Bullard and her fellow teachers want to “lift the ceiling on innovation” at Baldwin Hills Elementary.*

There’s a lot of talk lately about the need for intervention in urban schools that fail to put the best teachers in front of the kids who need them most. But what about an urban school where experienced teachers are routinely helping students excel? It turns out even high-performing schools need the right supports to nourish a thriving academic culture. 

At Baldwin Hills Elementary and Gifted/High Ability Magnet School in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), 99% of the student body is Black or Hispanic, and more than 70% of the students receive free- or reduced-price lunch. Compared to similar schools, though, Baldwin Hills is one of the best. The veteran staff has an average experience level of 15 years, including many award-winning educators. But they were starting to feel stifled. 

New leadership at the school was clashing with the culture of creativity that the teachers had come to love, a spirit which had spurned them to go above and beyond for the kids.
