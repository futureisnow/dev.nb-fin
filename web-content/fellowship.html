<h2>About the Fellowship</h2>
<p>The yearlong Network Fellowship brings together committed teachers to incubate solutions to the tough problems faced in public education. The program is designed to tap into teachers&rsquo; great ideas and cultivate them into real plans for change.</p>
<p>Our Fellows then take these concrete plans and push them into <strong>action</strong>. And that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Through the grassroots organizing approach of the Teacher Action Network, each teacher&rsquo;s action grows into something bigger&mdash;a movement.</p>
<h3>Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spend a year developing and implementing a pragmatic, scalable solution (<strong>action</strong>) to an educational challenge facing your school, district, and/or union.</li>
<li>Receive a <strong>$5,000 stipend</strong> for your commitment towards achieving your action.</li>
<li>Collaborate with other solutions-focused teachers in monthly full-cohort meetings.</li>
<li>Access professional development and capacity building in project management, leadership, organizing, and social media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Candidate Criteria</h3>
<p>Ideal candidates are developing or established teacher leaders who embrace the grassroots organizing of fellow educators to develop and implement solutions that positively impact teaching and learning.</p>
